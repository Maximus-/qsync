[[ qsync ]]

Setup Control Flow:
qsync uses ssh to start qsync on the remote
qsync on the remote indicates which port it's going to listen on? or maybe it just picks a high port and sticks to it forever. Ask IANA if we can have a port plz
qsync client connects to remote (how does it authenticate? use password scheme from quiccat, self signed certs? shared secret thats provided over initial SSH?)

File Transfer Control Flow:
Should client ask which files it has and the server asks for the files it wants?
Should server just list what it has, and the client decides what to send?
Make sure server can't ask for files that the client didn't advertise?

Should we multiplex streams over directories? so multiple directories can be indexed simultaneously?
